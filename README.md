Overall comments on grading questions:

1) Does your site make the information easy to find?
    - Better than the original, but some things could still be easier.
    - I have to dig into a PDF to find election dates & deadlines.

2) Are the pages reasonably structured with HTML?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - Could use containers like section more to subdivide page content.
    - Only li tags should really be inside ul tags (see absentee.html).

3) Are the pages tolerably styled with Bootstrap?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - The header and the nav make a kind of surprising color combination.
